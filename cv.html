      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <div class='section'>
        <p>I am a 22 year old software engineer, with a Computing MEng degree from
        Imperial College London (graduating July 2018).</p>
        <p>My interests include pro-environmental and blockchain technologies,
        network security and mobile development.</p>
        <p>I am experienced in iOS and Android development, as well as full-stack
        development (with more practical experience on the front-end), and
        blockchain development (specifically Ethereum Smart Contracts in Solidity).</p>

            <p><a href='https://github.com/louisdeb/naturalnet'>NaturalNet</a> is
            my dissertation projet at Imperial College. NaturalNet is an Android application
            which utilises decentralised networking (and opportunistic networking)
            techniques to solve communication issues during a natural disaster.</p>
            <p>Through exploring case studies of natural disasters I identified
            flaws in disaster preparation and response, and am addressing these
            issues with the application.</p>
            <p>The networking element is addressed through a modified version
            of <a href='https://github.com/OrganicityEu-Platform/oppnet'>OppNet</a>,
            an opportunistic networking service.</p>

            <p>3rd Rock was a company started by myself and three other Imperial
            College students. We developed a chat application, Mimi, which was
            designed as a result of conversations with a number of investors
            interested in producing a financial application for millenials.</p>

            <p>Mimi offered chat rooms in which bots could be added (in the same
            manner a contact would be added) to perform additional services, such
            as splitting bills, finding out the score on a football game, or
            making transactions among the group.</p>

            <p>I was one of two iOS developers at 3rd Rock, and learnt to create
            a scalable, maintainable application which communicated with an API
            designed between the mobile and back-end developers.</p>

            <p>I have been involved in a number of smaller projects at university
            and beyond, which have mostly involved iOS or web development.</p>

			<h2 class="rainbow">programs needed</h2>
			<p>So what programs do you NEED for making a website?</p>
			<p>Well the answer is any text editor, which would probably be Notepad (if you just went with what you've got)... but that totally sucks. There's no syntax coloring, or formatting. I've had to use it before, for an extensive page, and it's not fun.</p>
			<div class="center">
				<p>Here's my preferred programs:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">sublime text</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">notepad++</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>There are also some good web based editors:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://c9.io">Cloud9</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://codeanywhere.net">Codeanywhere</a></li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p>... though I don't have any experience in these, so <a href="http://twitter.com/louisdeb">tell me</a> what you think about them, and how they work out for you!</p>
			<div class="center">
				<p>DON'T USE WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get)</p>
			</div>
			<p>Using these kinds of programs will create crappy code which won't work on all browsers and will certainly fail on phones and so on. It also means if you want to change something later on it'll be a pain in the arse. So I should put some information about Dreamweaver here. A lot of you will know Dreamweaver as <i>the</i> web IDE. There are some good things about Dreamweaver - it has code validation, and your page can update live as you code. But don't use the WYSIWYG features. (Though I will admit if you know how to use WYSIWYG it can be good)</p>
			<p>And finally you need a web browser (duh). Make sure it's NOT Internet Explorer. I've given up making sure my code is compatible with IE. It's just so behind other browsers. (Some say recent builds are up to par... but I guess let your experience speak for you)</p>
			<p>You should code firstly for optimization on your own preferred web browser, and then follow up on others later. You don't want to ruin any creativity by spending your time making sure that your list is nicely aligned in Firefox and Chrome.</p>
			<p>It may be a good idea to get to grips with the web console from your browser (probably found via tools). It will give you information about problems with your HTML, CSS and JS (javascript).</p>
			<p>You can also right-click a web page and get some quick tools for yourself. Firstly the 'View Page Source' button will bring up the code behind the HTML document. This is really helpful if you want to know how someone did something, and how you can remake it, or improve it, or even just learn what they did. Reverse engineering web pages is great practice. The next thing to use it 'Inspect Element'. This will focus in on an element of a webpage and tell you information about it (css rules, sizings and bounding boxes, etc.).</p>
			<p>Hopefully by now you're comfortable checking out the code behind a webpage. If something isn't going right, <a href="mailto:debeaumont.louis@googlemail.com">drop me a line</a>.</p>

			<img height="80" src="images/fezbreak.png" alt="content break">

			<h2 class="rainbow">the core code</h2>
			<p>So how do I write an HTML document? Well, first of all we need to tell the computer that it is an HTML doc. Once we've got our file created in our editer we can just save it 'page.html' or something. The '.html' is the important bit. We can take this a step further and write down (in the doc) that this is an HTML doc. At the very top you'd write:</p>
			<div class="code-wrapper">
				<div class="code">					
					<p class="indent1">&#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;</p>					
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>but to be honest that isn't that necessary. Modern browsers don't require this.</p>
			<p>HTML works using a group of tags. Each tag is enclosed by &#60; and &#62;. (Generally) A tag is opened, then content is inserted in between, and then the tag is closed. To open a tag you write &#60; 'tag name' &#62;. To close a tag you write &#60;/ 'tag name' &#62;</p>
			<p>You can have tags inside of tags.</p>
			<div class="center">
			<p>So let's look at the basic tags. Here's a list:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>html</li>
					<li>head</li>
					<li>body</li>
					<li>header</li>
					<li>footer</li>
					<p></p>
					<li>link*</li>
					<li>meta*</li>
					<li>script*</li>
					<li>img*</li>
					<p></p>
					<li>div</li>
					<li>span</li>
					<li>p</li>
					<li>a</li>
					<p></p>
					<li>ol</li>
					<li>ul</li>
					<li>li</li>
					<p></p>
					<li>table</li>
					<li>tr</li>
					<li>td</li>
					<p></p>
					<li>h1, h2, h3...h6</li>
					<li>em, i</li>
					<li>strong, b</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p style="text-align: right">Tags with *s don't need to be opened then closed - everything goes within a single tag.</p>
			<p>We'll leave it at that for now. If that scares you, don't worry. Once you read about what each one does, you'll go 'Oh okay that makes sense I see why there is a tag for that!' and a huge list won't be a bad thing.</p>
			<p>And this is what each one means:</p>
			<p><b>html</b>: this has to enclose your whole document and all your code (except the !DOCTYPE html if you're including that).</p>
			<p><b>head</b>: this is for stuff which is a part of your page but isn't something that goes on screen. For example links to external bits of code, or stuff to tell a search engine. This goes at the top, after your opening html tag.</p>
			<p><b>body</b>: place all the code which defines things that will show up on your page, like words and pictures. This goes after you've closed your head tag.</p>
			<p><b>header</b>: used for what would semantically (what it contains) be your header.</p>
			<p><b>footer</b>: what would semantically be your footer.</p>
			<div class="center"><p>--</p></div>
			<p><b>link</b>: this links to every external piece of code, like scripts or stylesheets (css) or even a font.</p>
			<p><b>meta</b>: this allows you to provide information about the webpage - it's author, keywords, a description, etc. This is important for SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) - i.e. helping Google know to show your page when someone searches for it, or something like it.</p>
			<p><b>script</b>: can enclose some javascript, or can just link to it.</p>
			<p><b>img</b>: used to put an image on the page.</p>
			<div class="center"><p>--</p></div>
			<p><b>div</b>: used to define a section of the web page (for example on this page, each section (the core code, comments etc.) is its own div).</p>
			<p><b>span</b>: like a div, except it doesn't take up any space for itself. If I put a div tage in, it'd create a new line and put it there. If I put a span in, it wouldn't make a difference. This can be used for changing <span style="color: #fe6a86">colors</span> of <span style="color: #54a8eb">words</span> in a line without affecting the line itself.</p>
			<p><b>p</b>: p stands for paragraph. p tags should enclose every bit of text you have (that isn't enclosed by a h1...h6 tag).</p>
			<p><b>a</b>: a stands for anchor. That probably didn't tell you much. It's a link (not to be confused with the link tag... um...). An a tag allows you to have a link that sends someone to another page, or to bring up an email address in an email.</p>
			<div class="center"><p>--</p></div>
			<p><b>ol</b>: ol stands for ordered list. It has numbers.</p>
			<p><b>ul</b>: ul stands for unordered list. It has bullet points. Although whatever comes before (in both ol and ul) can be customised in CSS.</p>
			<p><b>li</b>: li stands for list item, that's kind of self explanatory, I think. Wrap each thing in your list in an li tag.</p>
			<div class="center"><p>--</p></div>
			<p><b>table</b>: wraps the tr and td tags allowing you to form a table.</p>
			<p><b>tr</b>: stands for table row. This wraps td tags in every row. Every tr tag is a row in the table.</p>
			<p><b>td</b>: stands for table data. The actual content of the table goes within this.</p>
			<div class="center"><p>--</p></div>
			<p><b>h1...h6</b>: these are headers but apply to text, instead of the header we met earlier, which applies to a section of the page. h1 is header 1 and produces text considered more important than h2 and so on.</p>
			<p><b>em, i</b>: em stands for emphasised, i stands for italic. They make your text slanty.</p>
			<p><b>strong, b</b>: where b stands for bold. Thick text. Note that both em/i and strong/b aren't great practice, and really you should use CSS for this stuff. However it does make coding faster (I've used it in each of these definitions for speed).</p>
			<p>Remember to right-click and select 'View Page Source' to find out how someone's done something. Use it on this page to check out a lot of the tags we've talked about so far!</p>
			<p>So that's the core code, now let's make something of it. It seems people like 'hello world!' so here's an HTML 'hello world'.</p>
			<div class="code-wrapper">
				<div class="code">					
					<p class="indent1">&#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;html&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;body&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent2">&#60;p&#62;Hello World!&#60;/p&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/body&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/html&#62;</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Play around with them yourself, try make yourself a little website dedicated to your favourite indie games. Try a list with some pictures! If you don't get anything, Google it, or <a href="mailto:debeaumont.louis@googlemail.com">email me</a>. I'm more than happy to help out, even if it means chatting on Skype or something.</p>

			<img height="80" src="images/fezbreak.png" alt="content break">

			<h2 class="rainbow">comments</h2>
			<p>Comments are important in code, especially if the code is extensive or not totally obvious how it works or what it does. Any good programmer will agree with this.</p>
			<p>Comments in HTML are started with &#60;!-- and end with --&#62;.</p>
			<div class="code-wrapper">
				<div class="code">
					<p class="indent1">&#60;body&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent2">&#60;!-- This will not show up in the page --&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent2">&#60;p&#62;This will&#60;/p&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/body&#62;</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>HTML isn't computationally difficult, so your probably won't use a comment to explain what something does. It's more likely you'll want to use it to seperate  parts of your code. For example &#60;!-- COMMENTS SECTION --&#62;.</p>
			<p>Also be sure to check for a shortcut to create a comment in your program. I use Sublime Text which has ctrl + / . The HTML comment is kind of awkward to type, so it's worth checking it out.</p>

			<img height="80" src="images/fezbreak.png" alt="content break">

			<h2 class="rainbow">links</h2>
			<p>I think you can probably appreciate how important links are. To create a link we use the a tag. We then add various attributes to the link allowing it to point somewhere. This attribute is called href. Finally, within the a tags, we put the text (or even element) that the link will apply to.</p>
			<div class="code-wrapper">
				<div class="code">					
					<p class="indent1">&#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;html&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;body&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent2">&#60;a href="http://google.co.uk"&#62;Go to google&#60;/a&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/body&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/html&#62;</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>This will produce this:</p>
			<p><a class="default" href="http://google.co.uk">Go to google</a>.</p>
			<p>We can also apply a link to a photo:</p>
			<div class="code-wrapper">
				<div class="code">					
					<p class="indent1">&#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;html&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;body&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent2">&#60;a href="http://google.co.uk"&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent3">&#60;img src="http://google.co.uk/images/srpr/logo4w.png"&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent2">&#60;/a&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/body&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/html&#62;</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<a href="http://google.co.uk">
				<img src="http://google.co.uk/images/srpr/logo4w.png" alt="google logo">
			</a>

			<img height="80" src="images/fezbreak.png" alt="content break">

			<h2 class="rainbow">lists</h2>
			<p>There are 2 kinds of lists in HTML. An ordered list (ol), and an unordered list (ul). First, open your list element. Within your list element (ol or ul) you create li elements. And within these li elements goes your list content. This can be anything, an image, a video, a div with lots more stuff inside of it. So let's create a list:</p>
			<div class="code-wrapper">
				<div class="code">					
					<p class="indent1">&#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;html&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;body&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent2">&#60;p&#62;A list of indie games:&#60;/p&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent2">&#60;ul&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent3">&#60;li&#62;Fez&#60;/li&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent3">&#60;li&#62;English Country Tune&#60;/li&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent3">&#60;li&#62;Hotline Miami&#60;/li&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent2">&#60;/ul&#62;</p>					
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/body&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/html&#62;</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Which produces:</p>
			<p>A list of indie games:</p>
			<ul class="default">
				<li>Fez</li>
				<li>English Country Tune</li>
				<li>Hotline Miami</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You use ol in the same way, but instead of bullet points you get numbers.</p>

			<img height="80" src="images/fezbreak.png" alt="content break">

			<h2 class="rainbow">tables</h2>
			<p>A table consists of 3 elements. table, tr (table row), and td (table data). We start by opening the table element. Then for every row we open a table row. Within this table row goes our table data elements, and within those goes our content. Here's a table of game developers and their games:</p>
			<div class="code-wrapper">
				<div class="code">					
					<p class="indent1">&#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;html&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;body&#62;</p>					
					<p class="indent2">&#60;table&#62;</p>
						<p class="indent3">&#60;tr&#62;</p>
						<p class="indent4">&#60;td&#62;Edmund McMillen&#60;/td&#62;</p>
						<p class="indent4">&#60;td&#62;Super Meat Boy&#60;/td&#62;</p>
						<p class="indent3">&#60;/tr&#62;</p>
						<p class="indent3">&#60;tr&#62;</p>
						<p class="indent4">&#60;td&#62;Capybara Games&#60;/td&#62;</p>
						<p class="indent4">&#60;td&#62;Super Time Force&#60;/td&#62;</p>
						<p class="indent3">&#60;/tr&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent2">&#60;/table&#62;</p>				
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/body&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/html&#62;</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Which makes:</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>Edmund McMillen</td>
					<td>Super Meat Boy</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Capybara Games</td>
					<td>Super Time Force</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>That looks kinda crap for now... don't worry, when we get into CSS we can make everything we've gone through so far look much better.</p>

			<img height="80" src="images/fezbreak.png" alt="content break">

			<h2 class="rainbow">images, video, and audio</h2>
			<p>Let's start with images, it's as simple as a single tag. The img tag. This is one of the examples where you don't <b>have</b> to open and close the tag. Within the single tag you write src="". And within those "" goes your url of the image (but remember the http://) <b>or</b> a relative path to an image.</p>
			<p>We saw earlier that I produced an image of the Google logo. So here's how to bring up an image which is on your webserver. Suppose your file is in the same directory as a folder called images. And then suppose in that folder was an image called logo.png. As long as that relationship between HTML file and image is the same, we can use this bit of code:</p>
			<div class="code-wrapper">
				<div class="code">					
					<p class="indent1">&#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;html&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;body&#62;</p>					
					<p class="indent2">&#60;img src="images/logo.png"&#62;</p>					
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/body&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/html&#62;</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<img src="images/header2.gif" alt="example image">
			<p>That's very well, but now suppose that we have a directory (called 'website'). Within that directory we have 2 folders, one called 'images', another called 'pages', and your HTML document is in the pages folder. Now we have to go backwards to 'website' and <b>then</b> forwards to images. This src is slightly different, so watch carefully.</p> 
			<div class="code-wrapper">
				<div class="code">					
					<p class="indent1">&#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;html&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;body&#62;</p>					
					<p class="indent2">&#60;img src="../images/logo.png"&#62;</p>					
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/body&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/html&#62;</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>The '..' means we go backwards by a directory. This can be chained; if we want to go back 2 directories we can write '../../images' and so on.</p>

			<p>Now onto videos.</p>
			<p>If your video is on Youtube, you've got it easy. On the video's page go to 'Share', and then 'Embed'. You can copy that iframe code that Youtube gives you, and simply pop that in your HTML.</p>
			<p>However if your video is stored on your webserver then you've got to use the HTML video tag. Within the video tag goes a source tag which we treat like an img tag (both have a src attribute). We also need to add a type attribute. This looks like 'video/<b>video type</b>'. We need to add some dimensions to our video tag as well. Finally this would produce what appears to be an image, so we add the word 'controls' to our video tag.</p>
			<p>We can also add multiple sources, with different file types, in case that the device the video is being viewed on doesn't support one video type. If the device doesn't support the video tag at all (older browsers) then we can add some text after all our sources which will act as a fall back.</p>
			<div class="code-wrapper">
				<div class="code">					
					<p class="indent1">&#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;html&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;body&#62;</p>					
					<p class="indent2">&#60;video width="1080" height="720" controls&#62;</p>
						<p class="indent3">&#60;source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4"&#62;</p>
						<p class="indent3">Your device doesn't support the video tag.</p>
					<p class="indent2">&#60;/video&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/body&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/html&#62;</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>And finally audio.</p>
			<p>This works a lot like the video tag. The audio tag encloses multiple source tags. However it doesn't require any dimension attributes.</p>
			<div class="code-wrapper">
				<div class="code">					
					<p class="indent1">&#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;html&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;body&#62;</p>					
					<p class="indent2">&#60;audio controls&#62;</p>
						<p class="indent3">&#60;source src="song.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"&#62;</p>
						<p class="indent3">&#60;source src="song.wav" type="audio/wav"&#62;</p>
						<p class="indent3">Your device doesn't support the audio tag.</p>
					<p class="indent2">&#60;/video&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/body&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/html&#62;</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<img height="80" src="images/fezbreak.png" alt="content break">

			<h2 class="rainbow">adding external resources</h2>
			<p>There are a few different external resources you'll regularly come across when creating a website.</p>
			<div class="center">
				<ul>
					<li>stylesheets</li>
					<li>fonts</li>
					<li>scripts</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p>All of these can be referenced through the link tag. Here's how: </p>
			<div class="code-wrapper">
				<div class="code">					
					<p class="indent1">&#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;</p>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;html&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;head&#62;</p>					
					<p class="indent2">&#60;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&#62;</p>					
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/head&#62;</p>
					<br>
					<p class="indent1">&#60;/html&#62;</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>href is the actual link to the file. The other attribute (rel) is information about the file you're linking to.</p>
			<p>You should use external stylesheets. This means that if you have multiple webpages you don't have to copy and paste your whole stylesheet. (Though I should tell you that you can put styling on a page by using the style tags placed inside the head)</p>
			<p>If you want to include a font, it's easiest if you find it on <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/">google fonts</a> and then copy their link code. <b>However</b> you can use @font-face to include it from a webserver, but I don't wanna go into how this works, as I can rarely make it work myself :/</p>

			<img height="80" src="images/fezbreak.png" alt="content break">		

			<p>So that's HTML. There are some really good resources which go into more detail on these, and more tags. The official resource is <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3 Schools</a>, which should be a first port of call if you're having trouble with your code.</p>

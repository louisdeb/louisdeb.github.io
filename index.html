              A song by myself and friend and songwriter <a href='https://www.instagram.com/danferguson02/'>Dan Ferguson</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I asked Dan for some tips regarding songwriting, and he came back suggesting we tried
              some together. Sat in the old Camden kitchen, I played him this riff
              (written while listening to the duckies laughing at 11pm, Friday night,
              Regent's Park, old, dead Yamaha acoustic) and he dug it, 
              recorded it, and went away working, whittling it down,
              working it all out.
            </p>
            <p>
              (For the life of me I couldn't put a lyric to it let alone sing over it let alone sing.)
            </p>
            <p>
              What came out was this stormish blues. And you should've seen it on stage,
              those first few times (at Spiritual Bar, naturally).

              I was invited to share a song for the Bert Jansch Foundation's event
              Around The World In 80 Plays. You can see what I wrote for the event
              and the piece I shared
              <a href='https://80plays.bertjanschfoundation.org/the-artists/louis_de_beaumont/'>here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              I looked after their 'Jonny' guitar for a month or two, and hosted
              a number of musicians and friends to also play, who are:<br /><br />

          <div class="album-content" style="height:0">
            <p>
              Recorded at home on Monday 11th February 2019. <br />
              Sitting 1 consists of 4 original pieces: White Horses, Like A Dog, The Second Hand, and Summertime. <br />
              Sitting 2 consists of 2 improvisations.
            </p>

            <p>
              I didn't particularly enjoy trying to get 'perfect' takes of each song. Each Sitting is a continuous take. At the time of recording I was yearning for expressive freedom and to get some higher quality recordings of my songs. The yearning partly accounts for the content in between songs.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sitting 2 was recorded half an hour after Sitting 1.

              This album felt too personal to publicly release. If you have found it here, you have found the only public li<a href='https://soundcloud.com/louisdeb/sets/album-1/s-gtE1E' style='color:inherit'>n</a>k I have put to this album.

              Recorded at The Green Note in Camden Town at the open mic on Tuesday 23rd October 2018, by Jo Griggs. <br />
              I spent the whole day beforehand trying to get an 'album worthy' take of Bird Song.
